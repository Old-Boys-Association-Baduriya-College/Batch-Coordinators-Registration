🛑 Attention Batch Coordinators 🛑

The Old Boys' Association (OBA) is in the process of updating the Batch Coordinators' details for our upcoming projects. 

We are planning to have B2B Cricket, B2B Football, and a massive event which will be a Back to School to bring all past pupils back to school  .

To help us organize these events, we kindly request that you provide us with the updated contact details of your batch coordinators.

Your prompt response will be greatly appreciated and will help ensure the participation of all our past pupils. 🙏

Thank you for your cooperation! 💪
